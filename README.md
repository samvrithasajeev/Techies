### Project Description
An Expense Tracker with Budget Planner is a web application that helps users record their daily expenses and manage their income effectively. It allows users to set monthly budgets, track spending by category, and monitor savings. This helps user to control unnecessary expenses and improve financial planning habits.

### The Problem statement
An Expense Tracker with Budget Planner solves the problem of unorganized spending and poor financial planning faced by many individuals. People often lose track of daily expenses and exceed their budgets without realizing it. This system helps users monitor their income and expenses, control overspending, and manage savings more effectively.

### The Solution
We are solving this by creating a web-based Expense Tracker with Budget Planner that records daily income and expenses and automatically updates the remaining balance in the database. The system securely stores user data even after logout and provides real-time budget tracking and spending analysis. This helps users manage their money efficiently and avoid overspending.
